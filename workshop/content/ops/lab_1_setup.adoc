== Environment Setup

Your environment has already been set up and you are ready to deploy your first ROSA cluster.

Your workshop environment consists of several components which have been pre-configured and are ready to use.
This includes a %aws_web_console_url%[Amazon Web Services (AWS)] account, and many other supporting resources.

ROSA is enabled on the AWS account used for this lab - and the ROSA CLI as well as AWS CLI tools are installed and configured on your bastion VM.

== Connect to your bastion VM

. In the terminal window to the right connect to the bastion VM (you can also just click the command below to have it copied and executed automatically):
+
[TIP]
====
Answer `yes` when asked if to accept the host key.

The password for the user %rosa_bastion_user_name% is `%rosa_user_password%`
====
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
ssh -o ServerAliveInterval=600 %rosa_bastion_user_name%@bastion.%rosa_subdomain_base%
----

=== Validate installed tools

You will be using the `rosa`, `aws` and `oc` command line tools throughout this lab.

. Verify that the `rosa` command line tool is installed:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
rosa version
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,texinfo]
----
1.2.15
Your ROSA CLI is up to date.
----

. Verify that the `aws` command line tool is installed:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
aws --version
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
aws-cli/2.11.14 Python/3.11.3 Linux/4.18.0-305.82.1.el8_4.x86_64 exe/x86_64.rhel.8 prompt/off
----

. Verify that the `aws` command line tool is configured:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
aws sts get-caller-identity
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,texinfo]
----
{
    "UserId": "AIDA52VPS74UJLY4GUW7L",
    "Account": "950629760808",
    "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::950629760808:user/wkulhane@redhat.com-nhnv4"
}
----

. Download and install the oc binary. The `rosa` CLI has the capability to automatically download the latest version of the oc binary (`rosa download oc`).
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
cd $HOME
rosa download oc

mkdir $HOME/bin
tar -xzvf $HOME/openshift-client-linux.tar.gz -C $HOME/bin
rm $HOME/openshift-client-linux.tar.gz
----
+
*Why use `oc` over `kubectl`* +
Being Kubernetes, one can definitely use `kubectl` with their OpenShift cluster.
`oc` is specific to OpenShift in that it includes the standard set of features from `kubectl` plus additional support for OpenShift functionality. See https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/latest/cli_reference/openshift_cli/usage-oc-kubectl.html[Usage of oc and kubectl commands] for more details.

. Validate the version of the OpenShift CLI that got installed:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
oc version
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,text,options=nowrap]
----
Client Version: 4.12.14
Kustomize Version: v4.5.7
----

. Rosa login
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
rosa login
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,texinfo]
----
I: Logged in as 'rhpds-cloud' on 'https://api.openshift.com'
----
+
[NOTE]
====
Normally you would need to get a *token* from the https://console.redhat.com/openshift/token/rosa)[Red Hat Console] and log into ROSA using that token.

In this environment your token has been preconfigured for you.
====

. Run rosa whoami to verify your credentials:
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
rosa whoami
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,texinfo]

=== Verify quota

. Verify that your AWS account has enough quota in the region you will be deploying your cluster to.
+
[source,sh,role=execute]
----
rosa verify quota
----
+
.Sample Output
[source,texinfo,options=nowrap]
----
I: Validating AWS quota...
I: AWS quota ok. If cluster installation fails, validate actual AWS resource usage against https://docs.openshift.com/
rosa/rosa_getting_started/rosa-required-aws-service-quotas.html
----
+
See https://docs.openshift.com/rosa/rosa_planning/rosa-sts-required-aws-service-quotas.html[the documentation] for more details regarding quotas.

We have now successfully set up our account and environment and are ready to deploy our cluster.
